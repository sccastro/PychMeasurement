This repository for a bookdown book contains the lessons for a course entitled Psychological Measurement in R at the University of Utah.

<p> From the class:</p>
 "As a modern Psychologist, we can no longer be purely theoretical hypothesis generators, experimentalists, statisticians, or clinicians; now we must strive to be methodologically sound, balance experimental design against convenient populations, keep up with the ever-changing landscape of statistical tests and their caveats, and learn rudimentary computer programming on top of that! Therefore we need a tool that balances the comprehensibility of human language with the flexibility to keep up with developing statistical methods and the power to analyze any dataset. Enter R, the open-source statistical computing and graphics language with a powerful Integrated Development Environment (the Rstudio IDE), a robust community of developers, data scientists, and experts (who respond to questions!), and too many reputable online resources to read in a lifetime. The impetus to learn something new on top of your ongoing research may be hard to summon, but this course is designed to integrate your ongoing research projects into mastering R, and to provide tools for streamlining projects in the future."
